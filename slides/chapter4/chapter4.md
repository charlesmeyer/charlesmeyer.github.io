# Chapter 4
## Vectors and Scalars



## Goals

- Key concepts, principles, and representation of vectors
- Preform vector operations graphically
- Decompose and compose vectors using trig functions
- Do operations on vectors mathematically
- Why we are using vectors?



## **4A** Properties of Vectors and Scalars



### Vectors vs. Scalars

Vectors have magnitude and direction <!-- .element: class="fragment"-->
Scalars have only magnitude <!-- .element: class="fragment"-->



### Simple vectors are graphically represented by an arrow

* The length of the arrow represents the magnitude
* The arrow is in the direction of the displacement, velocity, etc.
* The position of the arrow does not matter



## Vector Angles



## Transporting Vectors
