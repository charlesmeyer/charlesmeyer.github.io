# Chapter 3
## Motion in One Dimension



## Goals

- Solve problems using the definitions of displacement, velocity, and acceleration
- Create and interpret graphs of position velocity and acceleration vs. time 
- Use the three equations of motion to solve problems involving constant acceleration 
- Use a computer to simulate and graph basic motion
- Know symbols, SI units, and terms related to the physics of motion

**d** $\equiv $ displacement

Change in position - vector 



$d_{x} \equiv$ displacement in the x direction


Displacement is not dependent on path



$\Delta x \equiv $ change in x i.e. $d_{x}$

$d\_{x} = \Delta x = x\_{f} - x\_{i}$



Ex: Usain Bolt starts 0.32m behind the starting line and crosses the finish line at 100.0m. What is his displacement?



Ex: A golf ball is dropped from 0.50m above the ground. After 0.04s, the ball is 0.393m above the ground. What is the ball's displacement?



$$speed = \frac{distance}{time}$$



Velocity: Speed with direction


$$\bar{v} = \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}

Average velosity is defined as change in position devided by change in time


More gereally

$$\bar{v} = \frac{\mathbf{d}}{\Delta t}$$


$$speed = \frac{\left |\Delta {x}  \right |}{\Delta t}$$



Ex: Usain Bolt set the world record for the 100m dash in 2009 with a tine of 9.58 seconds. Shat was his average velosity?
