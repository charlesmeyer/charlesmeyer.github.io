# Chapter 3
## Motion in One Dimension



## Goals

- Solve problems using the definitions of displacement, velocity, and acceleration
- Create and interpret graphs of position velocity and acceleration vs. time 
- Use the three equations of motion to solve problems involving constant acceleration 
- Use a computer to simulate and graph basic motion
- Know symbols, SI units, and terms related to the physics of motion
