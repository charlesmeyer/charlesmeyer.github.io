## **2A** Dimensions of Physics



### SI

- International System of Units (_S_ystem _I_nternational dUnites)
- New version of the Metric system introduced in 1960
- Universally accepted standard for scientists
- Allows scientist to build off of the work of others

## electric current

Unit: ampere (A) - constant current which, if maintained in two straight parallel conductors of infinite length, of negligible circular cross-section, and placed 1 meter apart in vacuum, would produce between these conductors a force equal to 2 x 10-7 newton per meter of length

Symbol in equations: I <!-- .element: class="fragment"-->



## luminous intensity

Unit: candela (cd) - luminous intensity, in a given direction, of a source that emits monochromatic radiation of frequency 540 x 10<sup>12</sup> hertz and that has a radiant intensity in that direction of 1/683 watt per square radian.
