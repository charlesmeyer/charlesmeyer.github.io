## **1A** Why Study Physics



>"... have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth." _Genesis 1:28_



## **1B** What is Physics?



## Science


> Science is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe. <!-- .element: class="fragment"-->

from Latin scientia, meaning "knowledge" <!-- .element: class="fragment"-->

## Hypothesis
a proposed _testable_ explanation for a phenomenon <!-- .element: class="fragment"-->



## Theory

> A rigorously developed framework that explains and predicts _why_ many phenomena take place<!-- .element: class="fragment"-->



## Law

> A descriptive account of _how_ nature will behave under certain conditions <!-- .element: class="fragment"-->



## Empirical Science

> Science based _observation_ or _experimentation_ <!-- .element: class="fragment"-->


## Model

> A usable simplified reflection of reality



## Paradigm

> A widely accepted thought pattern with which we try to fit new ideas


### _The Structure of Scientific Revolutions_
Thomas Kuhn

> "Successive transition from one paradigm to another via revolution is the usual developmental pattern of mature science."

### A good (workable) hypothesis
- Reasonable
- Testable
- Should not ~~contradict~~ established principles
- Explain current observations and predict new ones 
- Simple as posible
