# Chapter 1
## Foundations of Physics



## Goals

- Understand key terms used in science and physics
- Understand the scientific method
- Know how science can go wrong (vs. scientific ideal)
- Be able to identify why a hypothesis or theory is unusable



## **1A** Why Study Physics



>"... have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth." _Genesis 1:28_



## **1B** What is Physics?



## Science


> Science is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe.

from Latin scientia, meaning "knowledge" <!-- .element: class="fragment"-->

## Hypothesis
a proposed _testable_ explanation for a phenomenon



## Theory

> A rigorously developed framework that explains and predicts _why_ many phenomena take place



## Law

> A descriptive account of _how_ nature will behave under certain conditions



## Empirical Science

> Science based _observation_ or _experimentation_


## Model

> A usable simplified reflection of reality



## Paradigm

> A widely accepted thought pattern with which we try to fit new ideas


### _The Structure of Scientific Revolutions_
Thomas Kuhn

> "Successive transition from one paradigm to another via revolution is the usual developmental pattern of mature science."

- Testable <!-- .element: class="fragment"-->
- Should not contradict established principles <!-- .element: class="fragment"-->
- Explain current observations and predict new ones <!-- .element: class="fragment"-->
- Simple as possible <!-- .element: class="fragment"-->
