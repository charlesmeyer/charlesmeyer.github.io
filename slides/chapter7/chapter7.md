# Chapter 4
## Vectors and Scalars



## Goals

- Key concepts, principles, and representation of vectors
- Preform vector operations graphically
- Decompose and compose vectors using trig functions
- Do operations on vectors mathematically
- Why we are using vectors?



## **7A** Circular Motion



### Position In Circular motion

* Position is measured as a vector, $\mathbf{r}$
* Rotation is measured as an angle, $\theta$ , in radians
* Distance from centre is ,$ \mathit{r}$ , in meters
