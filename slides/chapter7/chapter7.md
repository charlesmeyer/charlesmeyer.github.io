# Chapter 7
## Circular Motion



## Goals

- Know units used in circular motion
- Be able to calculate angular velocity and acceleration for uniform circular motion
- Be able to calculate centripetal force
- Use the universal law of gravity



## **7A** Circular Motion



### Position In Circular motion

* Position is measured as a vector, $\mathbf{r}$
* Rotation is measured as an angle, $\theta$ , in radians
* Distance from centre is ,$ \mathit{r}$ , in meters
