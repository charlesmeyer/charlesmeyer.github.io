# Chapter 7
## Circular Motion



## Goals

- Know units used in circular motion
- Be able to calculate angular velocity and acceleration for uniform circular motion
- Be able to calculate centripetal force
- Use the universal law of gravity



## **7A** Circular Motion



### Position In Circular motion

* Position is measured as a vector, $\mathbf{r}$
* Rotation is measured as an angle, $\theta$ , in radians
* Distance from centre is ,$ \mathit{r}$ , in meters


Ex: If David swung his sling 4 and a half times before releasing the stone in the direction of the giant, what was the total rotational displacement of the sling?



## Angular Velocity

$$ \omega = \frac{\Delta \theta }{\Delta t} $$


## Angular Acceleration

$$ \alpha  = \frac{\Delta \omega }{\Delta t} $$



Term: **Uniform Circular Motion**

$$ \alpha = 0 $$



## Equations of Circular Motion



## Centripetal Acceleration


$$ \bar{a} = \frac{v\_{t}^{2}}{r} $$


$$ \mathbf{a}\_{c} = -\mathbf{r}\omega^{2} $$
